👋 Hi, I’m @AbbasPHD
👀 I’m interested in Digital Humanities, Natural Language Processing, and exploring intersections between literature and technology.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in text encoding (TEI/XML) and computational analysis of literary works.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI-driven literary analysis, digital editions of classic works, and research in English literature and technology.
